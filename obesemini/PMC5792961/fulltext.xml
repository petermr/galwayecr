These schools were randomly ordered and sequentially invited to participate. 144 eligible schools were approached to achieve the target recruitment of 54 schools. After baseline measurements 1467 year 1 pupils aged 5 and 6 years (control: 28 schools, 778 pupils) were randomised, using a blocked balancing algorithm. 53 schools remained in the trial and data on 1287 (87.7%) and 1169 (79.7%) pupils were available at first follow-up (15 month) and second follow-up (30 month), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>The 12 month intervention encouraged healthy eating and physical activity, including a daily additional 30 minute school time physical activity opportunity, a six week interactive skill based programme in conjunction with Aston Villa football club, signposting of local family physical activity opportunities through mail-outs every six months, and termly school led family workshops on healthy cooking skills.</p></sec><sec><title>Main outcome measures</title><p>The protocol defined primary outcomes, assessed blind to allocation, were between arm difference in body mass index (BMI) z score at 15 and 30 months.

The mean BMI z score was non-significantly lower in the intervention arm compared with the control arm at 15 months (mean difference &#x02212;0.075 (95% confidence interval &#x02212;0.183 to 0.033, P=0.18) in the baseline adjusted models.

<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Heterogeneity of study design and interventions precludes conclusions about which combination of components are likely to be most effective. Nevertheless, overall, longer duration, multicomponent interventions, targeting school curriculums and food and physical activity environments, providing teacher support, and extending activities to the home and community were more likely to be associated with positive results. However, trials to date have had several methodological weaknesses that limit recommendations for widespread implementation.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In particular, few previous trials reported longer term outcomes, subgroup effects, or cost effectiveness.</p><p>We report the results of the West Midlands ActiVe lifestyle and healthy Eating in School children (WAVES) study; a cluster randomised controlled trial evaluating an intervention that aims to prevent excess weight in primary school children.

</p><p>Primary schools in the West Midlands, UK, within 35 miles of the study centre were eligible for inclusion (n=980). The region includes a multiethnic population from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds living in rural and urban areas. We excluded schools with fewer than 17 year 1 (aged 5 and 6 years) pupils (minimum cluster size) or schools in &#x0201c;special measures&#x0201d; (unlikely to have capacity to contribute to study). Within participating schools, all children in year 1 at recruitment were eligible for inclusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions and intervention development</title><p>Irrespective of whether children participated in measurements, intervention delivery was at school class level to all eligible children and their families.</p><p>The development process of the WAVES study intervention commenced in 2005. We summarised intervention components incorporated in previous childhood obesity prevention trials (70 included studies within eight systematic reviews) in relation to setting, target behaviour, and type of activity. To help prioritise intervention components we then conducted focus groups with parents, school staff, and local health, government, and community members. The discussions considered the perceived importance and feasibility of implementation of techniques (eg, reward behaviours, role model, exposure to opportunities for physical activity), activities (eg, education materials, cooking workshops), and particular settings (eg, school curriculum, community setting). We checked prioritised ideas against available local resources, and the intervention package was formed with input from an expert group of professionals. Thus we balanced the prioritised intervention components (eg, role models to influence behaviour, or family campaigns) with the resources that were readily available in our setting (eg, the Villa Vitality programme described later). This intervention comprised activities within two broad aims: increasing children&#x02019;s physical activity levels through school and home and supporting the development of health behaviour skills in families through activity based learning.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The intervention was further refined following a feasibility study.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> That study showed that the proposed measurements could be completed successfully (measurements obtained for 574 out of 606 children with consent (95%) at baseline) and that loss to follow-up two years after baseline was at an acceptable level (follow-up measurements obtained for 83% and 86% of children in control and intervention schools, respectively). The feasibility study was not powered to investigate intervention outcomes, but the direction of effect was in favour of the intervention for most outcomes. In particular, children in the intervention arm compared with control arm had significantly lower adjusted BMI z scores at follow-up (&#x02212;0.15 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% confidence interval &#x02212;0.27 to &#x02212;0.03). <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> provides details of the finalised intervention.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of WAVES study intervention programme</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col width="33.6%" span="1"/><col width="35.32%" span="1"/><col width="16.95%" span="1"/><col width="14.13%" span="1"/><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" scope="col" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Intervention component <italic>and fit with stakeholder prioritisation</italic>

To enable subgroup analysis we stratified schools by ethnic mix of pupils, and we used a weighted random sampling strategy to increase the selection likelihood (3:1) of schools with a higher minority ethnic population. Using this method, we selected 200 schools, which were ordered using a random number generator and sequentially invited to participate. To allow measurement of a large number of children in a limited timeframe within study resources, we recruited and randomised the schools into two groups (27 schools in each group), one year apart. Parental informed consent was sought and verbal assent from the children was obtained for all measurements undertaken.</p></sec><sec><title>Participant assessment and data collection procedures</title><p>Baseline assessment took place when children were at the end of year 1 (aged 5 or 6 years). Outcome assessments using identical procedures were undertaken at 15 months (first follow-up) and 30 months (second follow-up) post-baseline (aged 7 or 8, and 8 or 9 years, respectively). In schools recruited in the first year (group 1), we further assessed at 39 months (third follow-up) post-baseline (aged 9 or 10 years), but this was not possible for schools recruited in the second year (group 2) within the trial timetable. We collected data from school records, direct assessment of participating children in school, and parent questionnaires distributed at the time of pupil measurements. Trained research staff undertook assessments using standardised protocols and validated instruments, as detailed in the protocol<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">table 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Sample size was based on the primary outcome (BMI z score), taking into account repeated measures (estimated correlation between measures=0.9), varying cluster size (assuming mean 25 (SD 23) cluster size), and likely estimates of the intraclass correlation coefficient (0 to 0.04). To detect a clinically meaningful difference of 0.25 BMI z score<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> between intervention and comparator groups with 90% power, a two sided &#x003b1; of 0.05, and estimated pupil dropout rate of 20%, we needed a follow-up sample of 1000 children from 50 schools. Allowing for school drop-out of 8%, we recruited 54 schools. This sample size also provides more than 80% power to detect a 0.125 difference in BMI z score (clinically important difference for prevention<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and an approximately 7% difference in the change of proportion of children who are overweight or obese from baseline to follow-up in control compared with intervention schools.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>A blocked balancing algorithm was used to randomise participating schools to intervention or comparator arms. Schools were randomly allocated according to a randomisation scheme, which minimised imbalance<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> on several characteristics: percentage of pupils eligible for free school meals (measure of deprivation), proportion of pupils from South Asian, black African-Caribbean, white, or other ethnic groups, and school size. We randomised the first 27 schools (group 1) within the first block. A year later we randomly allocated the remaining 27 schools (group 2) in a similar way, but conditioning on the allocations that had already been made in group 1.</p><p>To ensure concealment of allocation we carried out randomisation after baseline measurements. Sessional researchers blind to arm allocation mainly undertook further data collection. Supplementary figure 1 summarises the timeline for trial processes.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analyses of all outcomes were by intention to treat and are reported at 15, 30, and 39 months after baseline (3, 18, and 27 months after the end of the intervention). For the primary analyses (complete case analysis), we used mixed linear regression models for all continuous outcomes (eg, BMI z score) and Poisson mixed regression for binary outcomes to allow estimation of adjusted risk differences consistent with CONSORT guidelines. To accommodate any non-normality of the outcomes, we transformed data when necessary and when such transformation improved the model. The baseline adjusted model included the baseline measurement and treatment arm as the independent variables, and to account for the clustered nature of the sample, school as the random effect. We also report models further adjusted for prespecified baseline school and child level covariates. Planned subgroup analyses, using interaction tests, examined whether any intervention effects differed by ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status, baseline weight status, and fidelity of implementation.</p><p>Sensitivity analyses included using multiple imputation (using chained equations) for missing values for each outcome, exploring cluster heterogeneity by period (group 1 versus group 2 schools), and methods of adjusting for missing baseline variables to maximise use of available data and heterogeneity of the intraclass correlation coefficient in intervention and control arms. Additional details on the statistical methods are available in the final report, available through the National Institute for Health Research website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk">www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk</ext-link>).</p><p>We set the level of statistical significance at 0.05 (two sided) for the primary outcomes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">table 2</xref>) and at 0.01 for all other outcomes.

Context and information on programme differentiation influence all of these and were therefore also considered throughout this score allocation process. We then ranked schools by total score, and grouped the schools to reflect low, medium, or high intervention implementation. A detailed report on the method used to synthesise the process evaluation data is published elsewhere.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p></sec><sec><title>Changes to methods from trial registration stage</title><p>The trial registration was submitted before the practical planning for the trial had started. Some aspects were subsequently altered in the development of the trial protocol, but the trial registration was not updated and therefore does not incorporate these changes. Supplementary table 1 summarises all changes between trial registration and trial protocol. In particular, at the early planning stages for the trial (and before the start of baseline measurements) the investigator team modified the primary outcomes from those specified at trial registration. To increase power to detect change and for consistency and comparability with previous trials, we changed the primary outcome for clinical effectiveness from the binary variable specified in the registry (of difference in proportion of children categorised as overweight or obese between arms) to the continuous outcome specified in the protocol of difference in BMI z scores between arms. Concurrently this binary variable and the additional anthropometric measurements included as primary outcomes at trial registration were specified as secondary outcomes. The reporting of the trial is in keeping with the published protocol,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> which was submitted before the start of data analysis, but any differences between what is reported and the trial registration information are specified in both the text and the tables.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Patient and public involvement</title><p>Public involvement was a key feature of the early phases of trial development and feasibility testing before this main trial. Intervention development was informed by detailed consultation with parents, teachers, and other school staff. The intervention was further refined and the process for measuring outcomes tested and adapted by asking the children, parents, and teachers about their experiences during the feasibility study. Measures of wellbeing and body dissatisfaction were included as outcomes based on their perceived importance among school staff. Our research team includes an education advisor at the Health Education Service, who has regular contact with schools and advised on school and participant recruitment. No patients were involved in this trial.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>

<italic>Anthropometric measurements</italic>&#x02014;these are included as primary outcomes in trial registration information (see &#x0201c;Changes to methods from trial registration stage&#x0201d;). In the intervention arm compared with control arm, the baseline adjusted risk difference in the proportion of children who were overweight or obese was &#x02212;0.013 (99% confidence interval &#x02212;0.075 to 0.071, P=0.66) and 0.002 (&#x02212;0.068 to 0.093, P=0.95) at 15 and 30 months, respectively. The mean difference in sum of skinfolds, waist circumference z score, and body fat percentage were all non-significant, but slightly favoured the control group.</p><p>
<italic>Diet, physical activity, and blood pressure</italic>&#x02014;the mean differences in total daily energy intake, physical activity energy expenditure, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures between groups were inconsistent in direction and statistically non-significant at both follow-ups.</p><p>
<italic>Longer term clinical effectiveness</italic>&#x02014;among group 1 school participants who were followed up at 39 months (488 pupils (246 controls), 27 schools (14 controls)), the mean BMI z score was lower in the intervention arm compared with control arm in the baseline adjusted model (mean difference &#x02212;0.20, 99% confidence interval &#x02212;0.46 to 0.05, P=0.04) and further adjusted models (&#x02212;0.18; &#x02212;0.39 to 0.03, P=0.03). We were not aware of any contextual or intervention delivery aspects that differed between the groups. To investigate why the intervention appeared more effective at this later time point, we undertook post hoc analysis to consider whether schools recruited in group 1 differed from those in group 2, both in characteristics (see appendix, table A1) and in outcomes at earlier time points (see appendix, table A2). This showed a noticeable imbalance in baseline adiposity between arms in group 2 schools and baseline differences in ethnicity, deprivation, and adiposity between group 1 and group 2 schools. There was a significant interaction in the effect of the intervention on the primary outcome between groups (P=0.001 (first follow-up) and P=0.02 (second follow-up) in the partially adjusted model). Analysis of outcomes by school group showed a statistically significantly lower BMI z score in the intervention arm compared with control arm at first follow-up in group 1 schools (mean difference &#x02013;0.23, 95% confidence interval &#x02212;0.35 to &#x02212;0.12, P&#x0003c;0.01 for baseline adjusted model), which was maintained through to the third follow-up (although no longer statistically significant at the 1% level). In contrast there was no significant difference between arms at any time point in group 2 schools (see appendix, table A2).</p><p>
<italic>Harms</italic>&#x02014;quality of life, as total score or subdomains, social acceptance, or dissatisfaction with body image did not differ significantly between arms at any time. Thus we found no evidence of harm from the intervention.</p><p>

<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Briefly, the intervention was generally well implemented, although no school delivered all components completely as intended. The scores developed to represent overall fidelity of programme implementation show that just under half the schools (12/26) achieved at least 75% of the maximum possible score and only five schools failed to achieve at least 65% of that maximum. Teachers found the daily physical activity intervention component the most challenging to deliver, with only four of 26 schools (17%) achieving high implementation fidelity for that component and 58% of schools (15/26) allocated to the low implementation fidelity group. In contrast, 42% (11/26) and 65% (17/26) of schools achieved high implementation fidelity for the cooking workshop and Villa Vitality components, respectively, with classification to the low implementation fidelity group for 42% (11/26) (cooking workshop) and 27% (7/26) (Villa Vitality). However, despite some challenges to implementation, the interviews and focus groups indicated that the programme was often well received both by teachers<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and by parents and children (see box).<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>

However, confidence intervals did not exclude between arm differences in BMI z score of 0.125, thought to be clinically important for prevention. The intervention did not have any effects on secondary anthropometric, behavioural, or clinical outcomes, and there were no differential effects in prespecified subgroups. A clinically significant difference in BMI z score in favour of the intervention was seen in the first cohort of schools recruited that had data available at 39 months. Subsequent post hoc analysis suggests this may have been a cohort effect, with evidence of effectiveness in group 1 schools at all time points but no effect seen in group 2 schools at any time point. The outcomes used to assess harm did not differ between the groups.</p><sec><title>Strengths and weaknesses of this study</title><p>The WAVES study is a large childhood obesity prevention trial within a socioeconomically and ethnically diverse population, with sufficient sample size to assess the primary outcome. Phased development of the 12 month multicomponent intervention was guided by the Medical Research Council framework for complex interventions,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> including a successful feasibility trial.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The intervention comprised elements identified as promising in systematic reviews<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and incorporated a range of behaviour change techniques, including those associated with positive outcomes in previous childhood obesity prevention trials.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Outcomes were assessed with mainly objective measurements, using validated instruments and standardised protocols. Loss to follow-up was relatively small, with 80% of pupils retained to the second follow-up, and loss of one school. A prespecified analysis plan took account of clustering, and the findings were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses. This was also one of few trials that undertook longer term follow-up (39 months) to assess sustainability of intervention effects. Comprehensive process evaluation (described in more detail elsewhere<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) helped to contextualise the findings and to interpret the results.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p><p>Nevertheless, there were also several limitations. Parental consent for study measurements being obtained for only 60% of eligible children could introduce selection bias; however, a pupil level comparison of demographic characteristics (sex, ethnicity, deprivation) between those with and those without consent did not show any major differences. The balancing algorithm to allocate schools was based on whole school (cluster) level data. However, within clusters, only children from one year group were included, and just over half of those consented to study measurements. There was notable baseline imbalance between arms in the group 2 cohort (with the intervention arm having greater adiposity than the control arm), which, despite the use of adjustment methods, may have attenuated the main results. Statistical adjustment assumes a common linear relation between covariates and outcome in all clusters, and misspecification of the model may lead to both under-adjustment and over-adjustment. Baseline imbalance is a known limitation of cluster trials and can best be overcome with recruitment of larger numbers of clusters. Although follow-up to 30 months was in all groups, longer term follow-up (to 39 months) was limited to a subset of participating schools. The Child And Diet Evaluation Tool (CADET) provided a quick, practical dietary assessment tool with relatively low respondent burden,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> resulting in useable data from approximately 85% of children at baseline (81% first follow-up, 82% second follow-up). However, estimates of dietary intake may not reflect habitual intake, there was a risk of misreporting,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and there may have been seasonal variation<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> between data collection periods. Usable data on physical activity were available for 76% of children at baseline (60% first follow-up, 52% second follow-up). These are similar to the rates achieved in other such studies.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with other studies</title><p>Our results build on the findings of previous reviews and address limitations in previous childhood obesity prevention trials. Two systematic reviews suggested that there was moderate<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> to strong<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> evidence of effectiveness of school based interventions in preventing childhood obesity, although heterogeneity of interventions, variable design quality, and lack of longer term follow-up limit interpretation. A meta-analysis showed that the summary magnitude of effect on BMI z score compared with the control was &#x02212;0.15 units,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> which is smaller than the effect size used for estimating sample size in our trial. Nevertheless, the WAVES study was larger than the 21 previous obesity prevention trials with low risk of bias included in the meta-analysis (n=9 to 574). Since the publication of the reviews, findings from another UK cluster randomised controlled trial, the Active for Life Year 5 (AFLY5) including more than 2000 children from 60 schools are available.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The trial primarily attempted to influence activity levels and fruit and vegetable consumption, although it also reported on adiposity outcomes. The intervention was curriculum based, focusing on educational approaches rather than the more experiential skills based intervention in the WAVES study. In contrast with our trial, the target population was children at the end of the primary school years, when rates of obesity have already increased substantially, and included few children from minority ethnic groups and more deprived areas. Nevertheless, similar to our findings, there was no evidence of an intervention effect on behavioural or weight outcomes at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation of the findings</title><p>The balance of components, intensity, and behaviour change strategies used to deliver the intervention may have contributed to the absence of evidence of effect on the primary outcomes in WAVES and other trials. Although fidelity of implementation for the WAVES study intervention programme was reasonably high overall, no school delivered all components completely per protocol, and a few schools failed to deliver some or all of the components. This may have attenuated any effect.<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In addition, owing to competing demands on teachers, components that required greater teacher input tended to be less well implemented and this was the main explanation for differences in fidelity between components. This suggests that delivery of a more intensive teacher led intervention in a school setting would not be feasible without additional resources. Educational and experiential interventions of longer duration that are embedded within a whole school setting are likely to be prohibitively costly and complex to evaluate using clinical trial methods. The intervention was developed on the basis of promising strategies in trials published before the feasibility study (about 10 years before the definitive trial). As a result, strategies such as those based on behavioural economics aimed at altering the social and physical environment were not included as part of the intervention. Although the findings from the feasibility study suggested the WAVES intervention was promising, intervention delivery for the trial and subsequent follow-up measurements took place some years later, during which time wider environmental changes might have diluted any effects. Researcher contact with schools during the feasibility study was also much greater, but this was not replicable in the definitive trial with a larger number of schools and would not be implementable outside of a trial setting. Methodological limitations with baseline imbalance may have also contributed to the observed findings with heterogeneity of effect between schools. However, even the cohort effect observed in group 1 schools was small, suggesting that childhood obesity prevention is unlikely to be achieved by schools alone. While school is an important setting for influencing children&#x02019;s health behaviour, and delivery of knowledge and skills to support healthy lifestyles is one of its mandatory functions, wider influences from the family, community, media, and the food industry must also be considered. The qualitative data from teachers<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and parents,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> collected as part of our process evaluation, support the possibility that these wider influences have a greater effect than any school based intervention. A metasynthesis of qualitative studies exploring the role of primary schools in preventing childhood obesity highlighted the need for schools, parents, and government to work together to promote healthy lifestyles in children and to support activities in the school setting.<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The multicomponent WAVES study intervention, which was feasible to deliver and for which there was no evidence of harm, did not result in a statistically significant difference in BMI z score overall, and there was no evidence of effect on measured diet or physical activity levels in children. Although wider implementation of this intervention cannot be recommended for obesity prevention, the lower cost components could be considered by schools to fulfil their mandated responsibilities for education on health and wellbeing. Within the context of the wider evidence, it is likely that any effect of school based educational, motivational, and skill centred interventions on obesity prevention is small. Several community based interventions targeting wider environments have also been evaluated recently, using non-randomised experimental designs. Although a few of these have shown evidence of small effects and lower weight gain in children from intervention communities,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> the findings are not consistent<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and need further evaluation. Interventions based on behavioural economics such as nudge theory<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> also merit further investigation. Even marginal effects may be important within a wider systems approach to obesity prevention, which incorporates multiple agencies and widespread policy change to support healthy behaviours.</p><boxed-text id="boxb" content-type="4" position="float" orientation="portrait"><sec><title>What is already known on this topic</title><list list-type="simple" id="L2"><list-item><p>Comprehensive systematic reviews have suggested that school based interventions could be effective in preventing childhood obesity in high income countries</p></list-item><list-item><p>Heterogeneity in intervention components and outcomes limit practical recommendations</p></list-item><list-item><p>Furthermore, inconsistent findings in relation to differential effects on subgroups, and impact on inequalities, limited data on potential harms, process measures, and long term effects, as well as lack of data on cost effectiveness, restrict interpretation and wider applicability</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What this study adds</title><list list-type="simple" id="L3"><list-item><p>The WAVES study evaluated a theoretically informed, skills based intervention targeting children&#x02019;s diet and physical activity behaviours through schools and families</p></list-item><list-item><p>It did not result in any meaningful effect on adiposity, dietary intake, or physical activity after 15 or 30 months</p></list-item><list-item><p>Although such interventions can fulfil the responsibility of schools for wider education, without upstream support they are unlikely to halt the childhood obesity epidemic</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The order of authorship is based on relative contributions for the first five authors (PA to EF) and last author (KKC).
