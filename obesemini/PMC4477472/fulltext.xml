Effective interventions that can be disseminated to large numbers of at-risk children and their families are needed. The goals of the Early Childhood Obesity Prevention Program (ECHO) are to examine the 12-month efficacy of a primary obesity prevention program targeting the first year of life that is delivered by home visitors and that engages mothers as agents of change to modify their own behavior and their infant&#x02019;s behavior through education and skill-building around nutrition, physical activity, and wellness, and then &#x0201c;echoes&#x0201d; her training with linkages to neighborhood programs and resources.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Six family centers located in low-income neighborhoods in Hartford, CT were randomized into control and intervention neighborhoods. Fifty-seven mothers were recruited either prenatally or shortly after delivery into the Nurturing Families Network home visitation program; 27 lived in a control neighborhood and received the standard home visitation program and 30 lived in an intervention neighborhood and received both the standard home visitation program and the ECHO intervention. The intervention increases maternal skills in goal-setting, stimulus control and problem-solving, engages family members to support changes, links mothers to neighborhood resources and is embedded in the standard home visitation program. ECHO targets include breastfeeding, solids, juice and sugar-sweetened beverages, routines for sleep and responding to infant cues, television/screen time, and maternal diet and physical activity. We hypothesize that infants in ECHO will have been breastfed longer and exclusively, will have delayed introduction of solids and juice, have longer sleep duration, decreased television/screen time and a lower weight for length <italic>z</italic>-score at 12&#x000a0;months, and their mothers will have greater fruit and vegetable consumption and higher levels of physical activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>ECHO will provide important information about whether an enhanced behavior change curriculum integrated into an existing home visitation program, focused on the mother as the agent of change and linked to neighborhood resources is effective in changing energy balance behaviors in the infant and in the mother. If effective, the intervention could be widely disseminated to prevent obesity in young children.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02052518?term=NCT02052518&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02052518</ext-link> January 30, 2014.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Latino</kwd><kwd>African American</kwd><kwd>Low-income</kwd><kwd>Stimulus control</kwd><kwd>Primary prevention</kwd><kwd>Family wellness</kwd><kwd>Newborns</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>The prevalence of obesity in the United States has tripled in the past 40&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] with disproportionately higher rates in low-income children of color [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in rates of obesity appear during the preschool years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Not surprisingly, children with an elevated body mass index before 5&#x000a0;years of age are at increased risk of becoming obese adults, suggesting a need to intervene early in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Many childhood obesity prevention efforts have focused on school-age children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There is a small but growing body of literature on obesity prevention in young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These studies in young children suggest that parental involvement and engaging parents as agents of change are keys to early obesity prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. One recent pilot study educated mothers to recognize infant cues and to delay the introduction of solids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A second study used home visitors and incorporated maternal education into the <italic>Parents as Teachers</italic> program to increase fruit and vegetable consumption; they demonstrated a reduced weight for length and changes in parental behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Thus, parental education and maternal behavior change appear to be important components of obesity prevention. They may not, however, be sufficient to prevent obesity if mothers do not have access to, cannot afford, or don&#x02019;t know how to prepare quality food and/or don&#x02019;t feel safe in their community. Ecological models of obesity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) recognize the broader contextual influences on individuals including families, neighborhoods, culture and the greater society. Interventions using an ecological model support families to sustain change and, in adults, have been shown to promote greater weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Ecological model of obesity prevention program</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2015_1897_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Home visitors can support behavior change effectiveness and can reach high-risk pregnant women and mothers during this early and critical period in a culturally responsive way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. National home visitation programs provide health and psychosocial-related services to at-risk pregnant women and mothers of infants and toddlers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Home visitors have been used to improve self-management of diabetes and asthma and a few trials of home visitation for the prevention of obesity are currently on-going [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The Nurturing Families Network (NFN) is a nationally recognized, evidence-based home visitation program with credentialed educators, and in Connecticut, is a program of the Children&#x02019;s Trust Fund. The NFN Home Visitation Program uses two evidence-based curricula (<italic>Parents as Teachers-Born to Learn</italic> (PAT) and <italic>Partners for a Healthy Baby</italic> (Partners)) and a culturally diverse workforce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Both curricula achieve positive parenting and child outcomes, prevent child abuse, and enhance child development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The curricula provide some education on breastfeeding (2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;h), introduction of solids, and infant routines, but the content is primarily education-focused and mothers are not taught behavioral skills to implement recommended behaviors. The effect of the NFN Home Visitation Program on maternal obesogenic behaviors and its role in obesity prevention in young children are not known.</p><p>Obesity prevention programs that begin before habits have become established and that use home visitors and a developmental perspective to address environmental and community contextual issues in a culturally responsive way may be successful in preventing obesity in young children. These interventions, however, need to be delivered early in life since rapid weight gain in the first 6&#x000a0;months of life predicts future obesity in children, independent of birth weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Potential goals for interventions in children in the first year of life include increasing breastfeeding, reducing sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB)/juice consumption, delaying the introduction of solids, limiting television/screen time, establishing infant routines around sleep, and recognizing infant cues to hunger and satiety. Breastfeeding decreases initial weight gain and is one strategy for reducing childhood overweight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], although recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] have not found an obeso-protective effect. Breast milk, however, is the best nourishment for infants, and is a low-cost, readily available nutrient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no solids and no juice in the first 6&#x000a0;months of life but, in the United States, by 6&#x000a0;months of age, 50&#x000a0;% of infants consume sugar-sweetened beverages/juice daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and 65&#x000a0;% consume solids, usually cereals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Early SSB consumption has been associated with obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] while delaying the introduction of solids to 6&#x000a0;months of age and not mixing cereal in bottles reduces mean weight for length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Television viewing is obesogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television/screen time for children less than 2&#x000a0;years and no television in the bedroom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Helping parents to establish sleep routines and to recognize cues for hunger and satiety are obeso-protective while infant sleeping duration less than 11&#x000a0;h per day is associated with rapid weight gain by 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p>Understanding the context in which obesogenic behaviors occur, helping parents of very young children to establish positive behaviors, and linking families to community resources could prevent the development of obesity in young children. These goals are the foundation of an intervention called the <italic>Early Childhood Obesity Prevention Program (ECHO): Building Healthier Families and Communities.</italic> ECHO is a randomized, controlled trial designed to examine the efficacy at 12&#x000a0;months of a home visitation program that engages mothers as agents of change to modify their own behavior and their infant&#x02019;s behavior through education and skill building in the areas of nutrition, physical activity, and wellness, and then &#x0201c;echoes&#x0201d; her training with linkages to neighborhood programs (e.g., coupons to purchase fruits and vegetables at grocery stores and farmer&#x02019;s markets, parenting classes at Family Centers, neighborhood cooking classes). ECHO recruits pregnant women and new mothers who have agreed to participate in NFN&#x02019;s home visitation program and provides them with an enhanced curriculum that increases maternal skills in goal-setting, problem-solving, and stimulus control to target four specific infant-related behaviors (breastfeeding, SSB/juice consumption, introduction of solids, television/screen time and infant routines and cues around sleep and hunger and satiety) and follows the mother-infant dyad until the infant is 12&#x000a0;months of age. The program also provides education and linkages to community resources to improve the mother&#x02019;s health, nutrition and physical activity. The study&#x02019;s focus on newborns and mothers as agents of change adds to the small literature on obesity prevention in this critical developmental window.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview and hypotheses</title><p>Pregnant women or new mothers within one month of delivery who reside in one of six urban neighborhoods in Hartford, CT and were recruited into the NFN program were invited to participate in ECHO. These six neighborhoods were chosen because they are served by a Brighter Future Family (BFF) Center that is linked to the Nurturing Families Network home visitation program. Brighter Future Family Centers provide early childhood education programs and parenting classes designed to improve parents&#x02019; knowledge of child development and nurturing skills, support in earning a high school degree, understanding and speaking English, computer use and financial literacy and family play groups. Centers also provide information to parents about other community, city, state and national resources that might help them.</p><p>The six Brighter Future Family (BFF) Centers in Hartford, Connecticut and their NFN programs were paired by neighborhood socioeconomic and racial/ethnic characteristics (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and were randomly assigned to receive either the standard NFN home visitation program (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) or the enhanced NFN home visitation program (NFN+, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3). The goal was to recruit 60 mothers and their newborns (10 from each BFF Center and its corresponding neighborhood) for a total of 30 mother/newborn dyads from an intervention BFF Center and its neighborhood and 30 dyads from a control BFF Center and its neighborhood. All dyads received the standard NFN curriculum using PAT and Partners curricula with weekly home visits. In addition, the NFN+ dyads received an enhanced curriculum in the areas of goal-setting, problem-solving, stimulus control and skill-building related to nutrition, physical activity, cues, and routines as well as enhanced neighborhood community services including coupons for Farmer&#x02019;s Markets and grocery stores, cooking classes, and exercise classes.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographics of neighborhood pairs selected for randomization<sup>a</sup></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Neighborhood pair</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Average family income</td><td>$28,191</td><td>$46,730</td><td>$33,697</td></tr><tr><td>Poverty rate<sup>b</sup>

Secondary hypotheses of the study included that at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months, as compared to NFN families, NFN+ families would purchase, cook and serve more fruits and vegetables, demonstrate greater utilization of BFF Centers and community resources, and NFN+ infants would be less likely to have a weight for length greater than the 85<sup>th</sup> percentile. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Connecticut Children&#x02019;s Medical Center, was sponsored by the Hartford Childhood Wellness Alliance, and was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NICHD R21 HD073966-A01).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Women who were either prenatal or had just delivered a baby were screened for eligibility for the NFN program using the Revised Early Identification Screening Tool (Reid). The Reid screen consists of 17 items including poverty, unemployment, single head of household, substance abuse, psychiatric care or late prenatal care with a positive Reid screen score being 3 or more affirmative responses. Final eligibility for the NFN Home Visitation Program was determined using results from the Kempe Family Scale which was administered during the first home visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] by the NFN Supervisor. Prenatal women enrolled in NFN were further screened for eligibility in ECHO; final determination of eligibility occurred after the birth of the infant. Inclusion criteria for ECHO included singleton birth greater than 34&#x000a0;weeks gestation, any maternal race or ethnicity, no chronic conditions that could affect the growth or development of the infant and residence at the time of the infant&#x02019;s birth in an ECHO-designated neighborhood. Infants with major malformations, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit or a prolonged hospital stay or infants who were small for gestational age and required special or supplemental nutrition were excluded.</p><p>Between November 2013 and December 2014, 117 mothers were screened for enrollment in ECHO and 57 met all initial eligibility criteria, provided consent, and were randomized into either the intervention (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;30) or control (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;27) arms (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

The NFN worker observes the mother breastfeeding with special attention to the mother&#x02019;s state, infant attachment, positioning, frequency, and duration of feeding. The NFN worker counsels the mother about continuing to breastfeed when returning to work and refers mothers experiencing difficulties to Heritage and Pride, a breastfeeding support program in Hartford [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. While the decision to breastfeed has often been made prior to enrollment in ECHO, barriers to breastfeeding encountered by Latinas and Blacks (e.g., comfort, lack of social support) are addressed by the NFN+ workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Family wellness plan</title><p>This dynamic document is created in a partnership between the mother and the NFN+ worker. NFN+ workers teach mothers SMART goal setting principles (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, timely) and assist mothers in setting goals regarding their and their child&#x02019;s health behaviors. A plan for self-monitoring behaviors, specific to the behavior (s) selected for the Family Wellness Plan, is determined. Self-monitoring calendars are used to document behaviors and are reviewed at each visit. Maternal success in achieving her goals is emphasized. The following specific behavioral targets are emphasized as goals: extending breastfeeding duration and exclusivity, no SSB/juice consumption until 6&#x000a0;months and then less than 6&#x000a0;oz/day for the next 6&#x000a0;months, no solids before 6&#x000a0;months of age and no cereal in bottles, improving parenting skills by establishing daily routines, reading infant cues related to sleep, hunger and satiety and infant physical activity (&#x0201c;Tummy Time&#x0201d;), no television viewing, and no television in the bedroom. As mothers are successful with these infant-directed targets, NFN+ workers begin to discuss ways to create a healthier food and activity environment for the mother utilizing nutrition programs (Cooking Matters<sup>&#x000a9;</sup>, visits to Farmer&#x02019;s Markets/corner stores), activity programs (Yoga, Zumba) at the BFF Centers, and parenting classes. Mothers are encouraged to set small, personally meaningful and important goals and to document their goals and progress using self-monitoring calendars and a scrapbook (containing her Family Wellness Plan) created with her NFN+ worker.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Behavioral strategies</title><p>Modules for the core behavior skills are adapted from existing curricula (e.g. Husky Byte for SSB/juice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], Soothe/Sleep for routines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; Diabetes Prevention Program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] for core behavioral skills relevant to healthy eating and activity) and include interactive activities. NFN+ workers teach mothers core behavioral skills (e.g., goal- setting) relevant to the specific behavior. Emphasis is placed on stimulus control and changing the home environment to support healthy choices (e.g., enhancing visual cues for good dietary choices).</p><p>All program materials are available in English and Spanish and have been developed and tested with home visitors, Latina and Black members of the community and parents for content, literacy and cultural relevancy. Concerns in Latina and Black mothers about weight as a sign of health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], about being socially uncomfortable with breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], childhood obesity as a non-issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], television as an educational tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], and outdoor safety as a barrier to exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] are addressed.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Intervention strategies</title><p>Activities within each intervention strategy module take ~10-15 min of the scheduled 60&#x02013;90 min home visit and are delivered at different visits. Each targeted behavior is addressed in a series of interactive modules that can be divided into multiple 15-min segments. For example, the Sugar Sweetened Beverage Module has four &#x0201c;messages&#x0201d; linked to four activities. Message 1 stresses no juice in the first 6&#x000a0;months of life and comes with a bib that says &#x0201c;No Sugar drinks for me, I am sweet enough.&#x0201d; Message 2 teaches mothers to buy only 100&#x000a0;% fruit juice. Message 3 educates mothers about the sugar content of 100&#x000a0;% fruit juice and Message 4 stresses limiting juice consumption to less than 6 ounces a day from 6&#x000a0;months to 7&#x000a0;years of age. The messages build upon each other but can be delivered separately or together and in any order. NFN+ mothers are trained to recognize hunger and satiety cues in their infant and to establish sleep routines. Mothers are also taught how to use &#x0201c;Tummy Time&#x0201d; to enhance infant activity and development and how to avoid television viewing. In addition, mothers who are bottle feeding learn proper formula dilution, storage, and how to use hunger and satiety cues regardless of the milk volume consumed.

Modules begin with introduction of a topic and the recommendation followed by education related to the rationale for the recommendation. The importance to the mother and her confidence to implement the recommendations are then explored using importance and confidence rulers. This is followed by the mother creating a goal for herself or her infant related to the module and problem-solving around the goal. A list of community linkages and a self-monitoring calendar are then provided by the NFN+ worker. The calendar and use of these community linkages are reviewed with the mother in later visits and the goals are reinforced. If a mother has been unsuccessful in achieving her goal, the goal is reviewed and revised with new problem-solving strategies and a new self-monitoring calendar is completed for subsequent review.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Toolkit</title><p>Mothers are provided with different items related to each module and a picture of their infant engaged in the activity is taken to encourage use.

Interventions need to not only be successful but to also be capable of wide dissemination and implementation at reasonable cost.</p><p>The Early Childhood Obesity Prevention Program (ECHO) is a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of the early establishment of healthy behaviors in preventing childhood obesity in mothers of Latino and Black children from a low-income, urban community. It is an innovative, ecologically- and culturally-based intervention to obesity prevention. The intervention builds upon an existing home visitation program by incorporating maternal education with skill-building (goa-setting, problem-solving, self-monitoring, and stimulus control). The intervention then uses these core behavioral strategies to target 4 specific areas of behavior change (breastfeeding, delayed introduction of solids, delayed consumption of fruit juice, and infant routines including limiting television/screen time, recognizing cues for hunger and satiety and sleep duration) that mothers are open to change. The intervention has been designed to be incorporated into ongoing home visits which will enhance opportunities for wide dissemination. The intervention is also grounded in Behavior Theory and the Ecological Model of Childhood Obesity to activate mothers to implement new behaviors in the home. The intervention links mothers to community programs and resources, supports maternal changes, and provides feedback on achievement of specific goals determined by the mother within a culturally responsive framework. It also addresses concerns in Latina and Black mothers about weight as a sign of health, breastfeeding, television as an educational tool, and outdoor safety. The study is innovative in its focus on newborns, the use of mothers as agents of change, and the utilization of an existing home visitation program to enhance mother-infant outcomes. The intervention also sets the stage for lasting and endurable change by taking into account the child&#x02019;s environmental and social milieu and connecting families to neighborhood programs and resources to support behavior change.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>NFN</term><def><p>Nurturing Families Network</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NFN+</term><def><p>Enhanced NFN curriculum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAT</term><def><p><italic>Parents as Teachers-Born to Learn</italic></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Partners</term><def><p><italic>Partners for a Healthy Baby</italic></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SSB</term><def><p>Sugar-sweetened beverages</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BFF Center</term><def><p>Brighter Future Family Center</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MMC and AAG designed, planned, and oversaw all scientific aspects of the study.
